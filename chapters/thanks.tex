First and foremost, we want to express our appreciation to our supervisors, Professor Nguyen An Khuong and Le Dinh Thuan, for their patience, inspiration, and extensive expertise, all of which were crucial in assisting us with the thesis. Throughout the entire process of working on and producing the thesis, their advice was really helpful.

We also want to express our thankfulness to Le Nguyen Minh Khoi and Nguyen Van Hoa for their particular assistance and important information sharing. We cannot complete a fantastic thesis without their assistance.

In addition, we want to express our gratitude to our families and friends who have helped and supported us greatly during this thesis and our time at the university.
