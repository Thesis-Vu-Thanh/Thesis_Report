First and foremost, I want to express our appreciation to my supervisors, Professor Nguyen An Khuong and Le Dinh Thuan, for their patience, inspiration, and extensive expertise, all of which were crucial in assisting us with the thesis. Throughout the entire process of working on and producing the thesis, their advice was really helpful.

I also want to express my thankfulness to Le Nguyen Minh Khoi and Nguyen Van Hoa for their particular assistance and important information sharing. I cannot complete a fantastic thesis without their assistance.

During the thesis work, I worked with Trinh Cong Vu, but due to the procedures and conditions of registration, he was not allowed to do the graduation thesis this semester, so I acknowledge and thanks him for his contribution to the making of this thesis.

In addition, I want to express our gratitude to our families and friends who have helped and supported me greatly during this thesis and my time at the university.
