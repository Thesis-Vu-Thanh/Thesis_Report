\section{Motivation and problem statement}
\label{sec:motivation}
Websites have become necessary for every business, brand, institution, organization, and individual. Due to the amount of information it collects, web services are becoming targets of cybercriminals. In the modern environment, data retention via web apps is the most efficient method. A corporation may be scammed using fraudulent data, which could have disastrous consequences for its finances and credibility. Therefore, it is necessary to draw attention to newly created web applications and developers.

Web-based applications offer the general public and enterprises fast and simple services, they may be used for social media, email, banking, online shopping, education, or entertainment. There are many widely used apps, and each one of them has the potential to be the next big exploit for threat actors. Web applications can be attacked for a variety of reasons, including system flaws caused by incorrect coding, misconfigured web servers, application design flaws, or failure to validate forms. These flaws and vulnerabilities enable attackers to gain access to databases containing sensitive information. Web applications are an easy target for attackers because they must be available to customers at all times.

Threat actors detect easy targets in the enormous section of insecure online applications. Cyber attacks are malicious attempts to access a person's or an organization's computer systems, networks, or data without authorization. Private data can be stolen, held for ransom, or destroyed. Recently, cyber attacks have improved in sophistication and tenacity, making it simpler for attackers to compromise a weak system and do serious harm.

Cyber attacks devastate businesses of all sizes and in any sector. Not only do they put your data at risk, but they can also lead to financial losses, reputational damage, and disruption of operations. The most common cyber attacks are phishing, malware, distributed denial of services, and ransomware attacks\footnote{Parachute. \textit{Cyber Attack Statistics to Know in 2023}. \url{https://parachute.cloud/cyber-attack-statistics-data-and-trends/}}. 

Let's take a look at the statistics about cybersecurity by industry. Healthcare, throughout the past 12 years, this sector has experienced the most costly data breaches, the costs have even increased by 41.6\% from 2020 until 2022. At least 849 healthcare cybersecurity incidents and 571 data breaches were reported in 2022. The average financial loss due to data breaches in healthcare has skyrocketed from around USD 9 million to USD 10.10 million (2022). In the Finance industry, phishing attacks against banks and other financial institutions held the largest share, accounting for 23.2\% of all cyberattacks targeting the financial sector. In the first quarter of 2022, ransomware assaults increased by 35\% in the financial sectors. On average, financial organizations bore the second-highest data breach costs, at USD 5.97 million, just behind healthcare institutions (2022)\footnote{Parachute. \textit{Cyber Attack Statistics to Know in 2023}. \url{https://parachute.cloud/cyber-attack-statistics-data-and-trends/}}. 

From the above situation, we can see that tools like Firewalls play a crucial role in organizations' security systems. They are a powerful tool for preventing malicious traffic from entering or leaving an organization’s systems. Our group wanted to make some efforts to strengthen firewalls' cyber security, so we decided to choose this topic: Building a Security module for Web firewalls.
\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}
Given the necessity of cybersecurity in this era, we chose to construct a firewall add-on. This thesis will concentrate on identifying malicious requests that pass through the firewall. We want to apply machine learning to assist the WAF process a tremendous amount of requests per second swiftly and efficiently. The developed module should be able to validate the request and identify whether or not it is an attack.

To eliminate the high FP, a inherent weakness of rule-based WAF and assure the speed of the WAF, which must react nearly instantly to deliver an consistancy customer experience, the module will use two fast and simple machine learning models. Each model will run independently to generate an output, then combined the result to achieve the accuracy of at least 95\% as well as low latency of 5 miliseconds\footnote{Abdalslam.
